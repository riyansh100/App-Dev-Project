# App-Dev-Project

The application should allow users to sign up, log in using email or Google Sign-In, select a turf venue, pick a date and time slot, and book a time for usage. It should ensure that users are authenticated, prevent double booking of slots, and manage user sessions efficiently. The app should also display a waiting room feature, where users can view other users booked for the same slot, and a confirmation page summarizing booking details.
